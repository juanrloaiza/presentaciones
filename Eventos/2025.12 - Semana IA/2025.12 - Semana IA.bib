  abstract = {This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how AI is influencing and shaping various aspects within the academic context by using a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative investigation and qualitative analysis to explore AI impacts on undergraduate education. The findings indicate a significant positive correlation between AI usage and academic morale in the quantitative investigation, while results for research skills and ethical issues are not conclusive. Qualitative insights reveal positive factors affecting academic motivation and learning opportunities (e.g., increasing engagement with course content, tailored content, and saving time), but they can present ethical considerations. Given that this is a relatively new field of exploration, and taking into account the rapidly evolving nature of AI itself, there is a relatively insufficient amount of secondary data covering the relationships being studied in this paper. However, this study offers original contributions as variables derived from reviewed literature may have been inadequately explored in previous studies, lacking precision and depth. This study offers insights into the changing nature of AI in academia and identifies areas for further investigation.},

  abstract = {This study examines the reasons students give for seeking unacceptable levels of help with completion of their academic work. It aims to fill the gap in the literature by presenting a comprehensive review of the first-person reasons students have given for requesting that someone else completes their assignments and assessments for them. To this end, we analyzed a dataset composed of 5,000 messages from ten contract cheating services posted on the social media service Twitter. Unlike survey research that relies on participants' ability to recall and explain the events, this study uses discourse analysis that provides a snapshot of student behaviors from the moment they announce their intent to outsource the work, an area that has not previously been analyzed in the contract cheating research base. The reasons accompanying the solicitation of contract work were classified into five categories that include: academic aptitude, perseverance, personal issues, competing objectives, and self-discipline. One important insight of this study is that students appear to have a subjective threshold; they are willing to invest a certain amount of energy in any given assignment, and once the limit is reached outsourcing is sought as the means to quit without losing the qualification. Recommendations for addressing the issue of contract cheating and directions for future research are discussed.},

  abstract = {As generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools become increasingly embedded in academic writing practices, questions of authorship, integrity, and accountability require new assessment approaches. This study examines teacher-led interviews as a mediational assessment practice, informed by an integrative cultural–historical activity theory (iCHAT) perspective that emphasizes how reasoning, responsibility, and authorship develop through guided social interaction. Teacher-led interviews were designed to prompt students to explain and justify their research writing decisions, including how they engaged with GenAI support. Reflection data were collected from 24 Master’s-level English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students, who were asked to participate in short teacher-led interviews about their research proposal submissions as part of the unit assessment. Thematic analysis indicates that the interviews supported the emergence of an ethical orientation toward academic work, expressed through cognitive, emotional, and agentive developments. Students engaged more critically with ideas and AI-generated suggestions (cognitive), negotiated feelings of anxiety, fairness, and recognition (emotional), and adopted more proactive and self-regulated preparation strategies (agentive). These outcomes appeared to be shaped by how students experienced the interview (perezhivanie), suggesting that the interview reoriented the object and motive of the writing task from producing text to being able to account for one’s reasoning and decisions. The study proposes a cultural-historical framework conceptualizing teacher-led interviews as a mediational space where dialogic accountability supports reflective, ethical, and principled engagement with GenAI. Implications highlight the need for assessment practices that cultivate development through guided explanation rather than rely solely on detection or surveillance.},

  abstract = {Academic dishonesty is a pervasive problem undermining the effectiveness of educational institutions. From a motivational perspective, researchers have proposed achievement goals as antecedents of academic dishonesty. Empirical findings corroborate the notion that mastery goals (focus on learning and competence development) are negatively linked to academic dishonesty. However, even though theoretical considerations suggest positive links between performance goals (focus on competence demonstration) and academic dishonesty, empirical findings are mixed. To provide a better understanding of how goals matter for academic dishonesty, we conducted three-level meta-analyses encompassing 163 effect sizes from 33 studies and a total of 19,787 participants. We found a disproportional use of correlational designs (using self-report measures of academic dishonesty) and personal goal measures (opposed to surrounding goal structures). Evidence of publication bias was not found. Our results confirmed the expected negative associations between mastery goals and academic dishonesty and revealed heterogenous findings for performance goals, with indications of positive associations within behavioral and intentional dishonesty measures, but not within self-reports. To further clarify the associations between achievement goals and academic dishonesty, we call for more methodological rigor in the measurement of goals and dishonesty as well as multi-methods approaches when investigating their interplay.},

Using the theory of planned behavior as a theoretical framework this study, we found that students reframed GenAI cheating as a legitimate academic survival strategy rather than misconduct. College students strategically used GenAI primarily in general education courses considered less relevant to career goals while developing complex evasion strategies combining multiple AI tools. Peer influence emerged as a powerful factor in normalizing GenAI cheating, with students learning techniques through social networks and interpreting institutional ambiguity as implicit approval. It revealed that students exhibit remarkably high confidence in their ability to use AI undetected, exploiting technological and generational gaps in academic integrity monitoring. The collective normalization of GenAI for cheating writing use creates descriptive norms that powerfully influence individual behavior. Students also interpreted the lack of clear institutional guidance as a silent approval of their actions. The findings challenge conventional academic integrity paradigms. We contend also that writing pedagogy requires reconceptualization to integrate AI tools ethically, while addressing systemic pressures driving students toward misconduct. We suggest that traditional punitive approaches to academic integrity are insufficient in the AI era. Educational institutions must shift toward proactive ethical education, AI literacy programs, and policy frameworks that acknowledge technological realities. The study contributes to understanding how generative AI influences academic integrity perceptions and provides insights for developing effective institutional responses.},

Each completed three sessions under the same condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group (LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition (Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18 completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs, n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity. Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity, indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.},

However, some changes in reported behaviors differed depending on the type of cheating (social cheating, AI-related cheating, etc.). Additional survey questions about high school students’ AI chatbot usage and the perceived allowability of such technology revealed mixed opinions on the acceptability of using AI for various academic-related tasks. Most students did not think that using a chatbot to produce an entire paper or complete an entire assignment should be allowable. However, there was support for using AI chatbots to help students to start on assignments and papers and to help explain new concepts to them.},

While extensive research exists on academic misconduct and student perceptions of various infractions, there is limited understanding of how AI tools impact these views and whether their use constitutes a violation of academic integrity policies. This study explores university students’ awareness and perceptions of academic misconduct, particularly concerning AI tool usage. A survey of domestic and international students enrolled at major universities in the United States received 277 valid responses. The results reveal high awareness of university integrity policies and significant concern about the use of AI for writing papers, with substantial variance in perceptions of misconduct severity. Notably, using AI to write entire papers is seen as major misconduct by a majority, while smaller AI-assisted tasks are viewed as less severe. Regression analysis highlights the importance of ethical education, revealing that students who view AI writing as cheating and those who believe cheating is unethical perceive academic misconduct more seriously. Conversely, student demographics (major, educational level, gender, international status), awareness of AI detection tools, and perceived ethics of AI use show complex, often non-significant relationships with perceptions of misconduct severity. These findings provide indication that education and clear policy about AI usage and academic misconduct could be useful in addressing a growing number of infractions in the face of emerging AI trends.},

However, as is well known, AI generated content and outputs are unreliable. Hence human supervision and oversight of the outputs of AI are necessary to perform AI-assisted research ethically. This paper argues that proper human oversight and supervision of many significant research tasks performed by AI research assistants involve, in many ways, performing the very tasks that were meant to be outsourced to AI in the first place. This is the paradox of ethical AI-assisted research. If used ethically and responsibly, AI does not provide significant net benefits in terms of increased efficiency and time-saving for researchers. But then there is relatively little gain in using AI as a research assistant. I then highlight significant risks for researchers and academics who engage in unethical AI-assisted research. Finally, I claim that the role of AI in ethical and responsible academic research should be reserved for secondary, as opposed to primary, research tasks.},

  abstract = {Academic integrity is fundamental to effective education and learning yet cheating continues to occur in diverse forms within the higher education sector. It is essential that students are educated about, and understand the importance of, good academic practice. Strict standards of academic integrity help to ensure that knowledge is acquired in an honest and ethical manner, creating fairness and equity for students, ultimately enriching the student experience at university and the wider society’s trust in the value of university education. This literature review synthesizes the many varied reasons why students cheat, as presented in a large body of existing literature. We then turn our attention to what we can do as educators to help reduce the rates of academic misconduct. Factors influencing the propensity of students to cheat are diverse but relatively well understood. Whilst policing and applying appropriate punishments should be part of institutional responses to academic misconduct, it is clear that this is only part of the solution. We emphasize the need for a much broader range of proactive activities to be brought to bear. Many of these are educational in nature and should have benefits for students, staff and institutions beyond discouraging academic misconduct. Resource implication should not be a barrier to their implementation.},

The psychological tension accompanying the decision whether to use GenAI or not for a particular task may lead to “AI guilt”—students’ moral discomfort when using GenAI for traditionally human tasks. This study examines the impact of AI guilt on students’ use of ChatGPT for academic tasks, focusing on disciplinary differences between pure and applied fields. We conducted a survey at a Singaporean university, measuring AI guilt and ChatGPT usage. Using logistic regression analysis, we found that AI guilt significantly reduces ChatGPT use for creativity-based tasks but not for routine-based tasks. The relationship between AI guilt and ChatGPT use is linear in pure fields, while applied fields show a nonlinear pattern. Specifically, the perceived risk of being detected and potential academic penalties decreases ChatGPT use in creativity-based tasks for all samples, while rationalization tendencies increase it. Interestingly, the interaction between rationalization tendencies and perceived social norms reduces usage, reflecting the tension between internal justification and external pressures. Heterogeneous analysis shows that rationalization tendencies and perceived risk influence pure fields more, whereas social norms drive applied fields more. These results show how AI guilt varies across disciplines and affects task-level GenAI tool use, offering insights for developing tailored ethical guidelines and integration strategies in higher education.},

This review shows that factors such as increased pressure on students, poor academic integrity awareness, lack of up-to-date academic honor codes, and the unethical application of AI tools are prime contributing factors to cheating and plagiarism in HEIs. In a broader sense, all these factors are classified as individual, social, cultural, institutional, and technological factors that are responsible for this problem. This problem can be reduced by establishing ethical and moral development tutorials as well as formulating up-to-date honor codes considering AI tools. Furthermore, higher education institutions must develop anti-plagiarism detection software in order to detect plagiarism and aid students in improving academic writing and paraphrasing approaches. The findings of this systematic literature review provide useful insights for educators and policymakers to solve the complicated issue of cheating and plagiarism in higher education institutions.},
